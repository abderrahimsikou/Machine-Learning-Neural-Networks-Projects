# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart diseases using machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Uses a Random Forest model for prediction.
- Trains on a medical dataset to predict heart disease based on patient data.

## Files Structure
- `train_model.py`: Code to train the model.
- `predict.py`: Code to predict new data.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets for training and testing.
- `model/`: Contains the trained model (`heart_disease_model.pkl`) and the StandardScaler (`StandareScaler.pkl`).
