# Weather Prediction

This project aims to predict the weather condition using machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Uses a GradientBoosting algorithm model for prediction.
- This Model predicts the weather condition based on historical weather data.

## Files Structure
- `train_model.py`: Python Code to creat and train the model.
- `predict.py`: Python Code to make predictions on new data.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets for training and testing the model.
- `model/`: Contains the trained model (`model.pkl`) and the StandardScaler (`StandareScaler.pkl`).

## How to Use:
1. Run 'train_model.py' to train the model.
2. Use 'predict.py' to make prediction on new dataset.
