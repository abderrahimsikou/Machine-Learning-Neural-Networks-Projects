# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict Cardiovascular Disease using deep learning (Neural Networks[ANN]).

## Features
- Uses a deep learning to build model for prediction.
- Trains on a dataset to predict Cardiovascular Disease based on patient data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Keras & TensorFlow
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas

## Files Structure

- 'Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction.ipynb'     : Code to train the model.
- 'data/'                                       : Contains the datasets for training and testing.
- 'model.h5/'                                   : Contains the trained model(`model.h5`)
