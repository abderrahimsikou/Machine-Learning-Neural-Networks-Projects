# Video games sales prediction

This project aims to predict video games sales using machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Uses a LinearRegression model for prediction.
- This Model predicts video games sales based on historical sales data.

## Files Structure
- `train_Model.py`: Python Code to creat and train the model.
- `predict.py`: Python Code to make predictions on new data.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets for training and testing the model.
- `model/`: Contains the trained model (`model.pkl`) and the StandardScaler (`StandareScaler.pkl`).

## How to Use:
1. Run 'train_Model.py' to train the model on the historical video games sales data.
2. Use 'predict.py' to make prediction on new dataset.
