# Car Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project <Regression>)

This project aims to predict car price using machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Uses a RandomForest model for prediction.
- Trains on a car price dataset to predict new car price based data.
- The Model achieved r2_score up to "95%"

## Files Structure
- 'training_model.py'  : Code to train the model.
- 'prediction_code.py' : Code to predict new data.
- 'data/'              : Contains the datasets for training and testing.
- 'model.pkl/'         : Contains the trained model(`model.pkl`)
